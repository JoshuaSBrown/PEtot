Requires that LAPACK be installed

ERROR with line 409 in 
DIIS_comp.f

looks like the d is used to indicate a debug line for some reason the compiler is complaining about it

so I just commented the line out

Second consideration is the LAPACK env variable which has not been set
-llapack if std install

Need blas library for dgem algorithm
-lblas

Apparently if using blas and lapack still hit errors because the code relies on functions that are only available on essl a scientific package for IBM computers
